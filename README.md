# Fight the Foot Clan
This repository was created for UNCC's Coding Bootcamp homework assignment #4 with a goal of creating a fun and interactive web-based game. This time, the app must dynamically update the HTML with the jQuery library.

## Getting Started
Instructions:
There will be four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) displayed and each turtle has a random hidden value between 1 - 12. Shredder will reveal a random number at the start of the game between 19 - 120.

When you click on a TMNT, it will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
To win, you will need to match the TMNT score to Shredder's random number. You lose if your score goes above Shredder's random number.

The game will restart once you win or lose.Once a new game begins, the player should see a new random number and all the TMNTs will have four new hidden values. 



## Built With
HTML5
CSS3
Twitter-Bootstrap - Framework
JavaScript
jQuery - JavaScript Library

The player will have to guess the answer, just like in the Psychic Game. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters.
